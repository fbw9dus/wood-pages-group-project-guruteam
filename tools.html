            <p>Sotwood is usually from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces. Softwoods are not necessarily softer than hardwods.[1] In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, the range of density in hardwoods completely
                including that of softwoods. Some hardwoods are much harder than any sofwood. The woods of longleaf pine, Douglas fir, and yew are much harder in the mechanical sense than several hardwoods.
